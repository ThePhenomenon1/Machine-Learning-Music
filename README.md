# Machine-Learning-Music

Machine Learning - a subset of Artificial Intelligence

We use it to build a music recommender algorithm. Then we persist the model with joblib. 

The algorithm we use is theDecision Tree Classifier from Scikit-learn. Scikit-learn [with it's package sklearn] is the software ML library with efficient tools for predictive data analysis. It features neural networks and decision trees. Features classification, regression and clustering algorithms including support vector machines, random forests, gradient boosting and DBSCAN. It is designed to interoperate with the Python numerical and scientific libraries NumPy, SciPy and matplotlib. 

Scikit-learn has 100 to 200 models (called "estimators"), split into 3 categories:

1. Supervised Learning (linear regression, support vector machines, random forest, neural nets ...)
2. Unsupervised Learning (clustering, PCA, mixture models, manifold learning ...)
3. Dataset Transformation (preprocessing, text feature extraction, one-shot encoding)
